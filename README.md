  SOI: SIGAI Statement of Interest Activity
  <br>
</h1>


<h4 align="center">Weekly Activity that works as a <i>Statement Of Interest</i> in joining the SIGAI group of the ACM-UTEC Chapter.</h4>



## The Activity

Every week, every member of SIGAI have to select between:

* Enroll to one of any *[Coursera Guided Projects](https://blog.coursera.org/announcing-guided-projects/) related to AI*, finish it and share their certificate of completion with us.
* Enroll to our current <u>Core Learning</u> course on *Machine Learning* or *Deep Learning*.

Every *Coursera Guided Project* lasts from 1 to 3 hours whereas our *Core Learning courses* last 4 hours average. We are considering taking this amount of time once a week as an **statement of interest** of their will to be an active member of the SIGAI.

## Guidelines

1. This activity add *5 + i* participation points (PP) to every member of SIGAI, these points are valid in the context of our gamified impementation of SIGAI Membership at ACM-UTEC kown as "**Real Involvement Environment** (*RIE*)". 
2. *i* values for Coursera Guided Projects are:
   - 0 for Beginner Level Projects
   - 1 for Intermediate Level Projects
   - 2 for Advanced Level Projects
3. i equals 1 for Core Learning courses.
4. Completion of this activity are checked every Monday at 00:00 for Guided Projects and Core Learning. 
5. Specific cases nor listed above are subject to discussion in a SIGAI staff meeting.

## Rules

1. You can choose any day of the week in progress at any hour to complete this activity.
2. For **Guided Projects** is mandatory to complete all Beginner Level projects to unlock Intermediate Level projects. The same applies to Advanced Level projects.
3. For **Core Learning**, evaluation consists on time spend and activities took at the LMS.
