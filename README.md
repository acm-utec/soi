  <br>

<h4 align="center">Weekly Activity that works as a <i>Statement Of Interest</i> in joining the SIGAI group of the ACM-UTEC Chapter.</h4>



## The Activity

Every week, every member of SIGAI have to enroll to one of any *[Coursera Guided Projects](https://blog.coursera.org/announcing-guided-projects/) related to AI*, finish it and share their certificate of completion with us.

Every *Coursera Guided Project* lasts from 1 to 3 hours. We are considering taking this amount of time once a week as an **statement of interest** of their will to be an active member of the SIGAI.

## Guidelines

1. This activity add *5 + i* participation points (PP) to every member of SIGAI, these points are valid in the context of our soon-to-be-released gamified impementation of SIGAI Membership at ACM-UTEC codenamed **CPI**. 
2. i values are:
   - 0 for Beginner Level Projects
   - 1 for Intermediate Level Projects
   - 2 for Advanced Level Projects 
3. Completion of this activity are checked every Monday at 00:00
4. Specific cases nor listed above are subject to discussion in a SIGAI staff meeting.

## Rules

1. You can choose any day of the week in progress at any hour to complete this activity.
2. Is mandatory to complete all Beginner Level projects to unlock Intermediate Level projects. The same applies to Advanced Level projects.
